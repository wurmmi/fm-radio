# Simulation with Matlab / GNU Octave

The entire signal processing chain of an FM radio is simulated in Matlab/GNU Octave.

This concept engineering approach is used, to find a suitable receiver algorithm, that later will be implemented in hardware.

## Sender

The sender part replicates the signal, which is transmitted by an FM radio station. A simple audio file is used as the data signal.

## Receiver

The receiver part demodulates the received signal. Its output is the previously encoded audio stream.

## Instructions

In order to run the simulation, a few simple steps need to be followed, to setup the environment.

### Installation and Setup

Install Matlab, or the free alternative GNU Octave.

For Matlab, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://de.mathworks.com/help/install/).

For GNU Octave, simply run `sudo apt install octave`.
