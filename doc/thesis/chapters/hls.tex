\section{Advantages / Disadvantages}
    easy and much faster to get complex HDL code, such as image/video processing, through libraries like OpenCV. However, it is less optimized, and a developer still needs to have a strong hardware background, to be able to understand what is being generated in hardware from x lines of code in HLS/Cpp.
