\section{Common Testbench}
  \subsection{Architecture (same tb for VHDL and HLS-generated HDL)}
  \subsection{Framework cocotb, with ghdl compiler}
  Instantiate both HDL models in the testbench.\\
  Display a direct comparison of outputs in graphs. This is practical, since the cocotb framework runs in python and graphs can be generated using Python's matplotlib.

\section{Develop HLS compiler independent code (optional)}
  \subsection{Challenges}
  Different compilers use different \#pragmas, etc.\\
  The \#pragmas need to be within the code, at the appropriate positions, which makes it difficult to write compiler independent code....
