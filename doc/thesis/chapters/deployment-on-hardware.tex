\section{Additional Implementation}

Chapter \ref{cha:Implementation} already described the development of the main IP.
In order to embed this IP on actual hardware, a significant additional amount of implementation is neccessary.
In this section, these additional parts of the implementation, which specifically enable and support the deployment on hardware, are described.
