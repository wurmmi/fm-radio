  \section{Advantages / Disadvantages}
    easy and much faster to get complex HDL code, such as image/video processing, through libraries like OpenCV. However, it is less optimized, and a developer still needs to have a strong hardware background, to be able to understand what is being generated in hardware from x lines of code in HLS/Cpp.

    \subsection{Framework cocotb, with ghdl compiler}
        Instantiate both HDL models in the testbench.\\
        Display a direct comparison of outputs in graphs. This is practical, since the cocotb framework runs in python and graphs can be generated using Python's matplotlib.

  \section{Develop HLS compiler independent code (optional)}
    \subsection{Challenges}
     Different compilers use different \#pragmas, etc.\\
     The \#pragmas need to be within the code, at the appropriate positions, which makes it difficult to write compiler independent code....
