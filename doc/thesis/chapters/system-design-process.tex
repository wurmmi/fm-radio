\chapter{System Design Process}
\label{cha:SystemDesignProcess}

The process of system design is a central topic in the development of any product.
This chapter describes general techniques for system design.
However, they can also be directly applied to FPGA design.
Additionally, tools that are specifically used in FPGA design are introduced.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{General}

The following sections describe a generalized approach to system design.
A process called SIMILAR is explained, as well as selected topics that are relevant.
The researched information for this section is mainly based on \cite{BahillA.Terry2017TDiS}.

\subsection{The SIMILAR Process}

The SIMILAR process provides a general approach to problem solving.
It can be applied to any kind of problem that can be of technical, as well as non-technical nature, in order to successfully achieve the specified requirements.
The concept was developed by A.T. Bahill and B. Gissing, who evaluated and compared multiple existing processes to find their similarities.\\

The acronym SIMILAR consists of the following components.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{S}tate the Problem
  \item \textbf{I}nvestigate Alternatives
  \item \textbf{M}odel the System
  \item \textbf{I}ntegrate Components
  \item \textbf{L}aunch the System
  \item \textbf{A}ssess Performance
  \item \textbf{R}e-evaluate
\end{itemize}

Each of these terms represents a separate step in the process diagram shown in Fig.\ref{fig:similar_process}.
The steps can be seen as iterative and parallel, as the process runs during the product development cycle.

\subsubsection{State the Problem}

The very first step of the process is to state the problem that is to be solved.
This can be the initial definition of a new product, but can also be the definition of an improvement that is to be made for an existing product.
Because of that, input for the problem statement can be generated by various parties, such as customers, product developers, regulatory agencies or manufacturers, just to name a few.
In the process diagram, all these possible input parties are labeled as stakeholders.\\

An important guideline for the specification of this problem statement is, that each requirement is descibed in the way of \textit{what} needs to be done, not \textit{how} it needs to be done.\\

The problem statement is updated and improved by the Re-evaluate step, which is described later.

%%%%%
\subsubsection{Investigate Alternatives}

In almost any kind of problem, there are multiple ways in order to archieve a successful solution.
However, some solutions may be preferred over others because of certain criteria that are evaluated.
Such criteria may be cost, risk, schedule or performance.
Based on the combined evaluation of these factors, a decision in favor of one selected alternative is made.\\

It is important to note that this step is a repeated step.
This is necessary, since there may only be a few known facts available at the initial intestigation.
Further design steps, such as a first estimation of the intended design implementation, simulation results, or a prototype can provide more data and facts.
These can be used to re-evaluate the alternatives and consequently optimize the design process.
