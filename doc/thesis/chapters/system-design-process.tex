\chapter{System Design Process}
\label{cha:SystemDesignProcess}

The process of system design is a central topic in the development of any product.
This chapter describes general techniques for system design.
However, they can also be directly applied to FPGA design.
Additionally, tools that are specifically used in FPGA design are introduced.
